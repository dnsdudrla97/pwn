TEXT Segment infector --

gcc infect.c p.c -o infect
./infect host 7

7 is the minimum required length which is the number of bytes the movl $0x0, %eax; jmp *%eax code is.
This code is necessary to jump back to the original entry point after the parasite has been executed.
The parasite should be in p.c, and should end with the jump code that's already present. (You could
also use push/ret). The return_entry_start variable marks the offset where the parasite should be patched
with the memory address of the original entry point i.e

\xb8\x00\x00\x00\x00\xff\xe0

The offset would be 1, since we want to put the memory address in the 4 bytes of zeroes starting after xb8.

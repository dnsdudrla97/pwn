This README file is very limited since Quenya was never meant to be released.
Although Quenya is very functional, it is mostly available for research purposes
into the ELF format, and what it means to hack ELF binaries, and process images.
To compile:

cd libptrace;
./configure; make

cd libdasm-1.5; make

Then in top directory of quenya type make.

./quenya

Once at command prompt type help
